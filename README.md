# Pomodoro

**[Demo](https://pakkudon.github.io/pomodoro/)**

Used to be a simple HTML + CSS + Vanilla JS application, then decided to over-engineer it for fun

Currently uses:
- HTML
- CSS Modules
- React
- Redux
- Webpack

## Development

Built using Node v8.10. To get this running locally run:
```sh
# Pull repository down and navigate into it
git clone git@github.com:PakkuDon/pomodoro.git
cd pomodoro
# Install dependencies
yarn
# Start dev server
yarn start:dev
```
